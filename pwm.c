 * The function responsible for trigger the Timer0 with the PWM Mode.
 *  Setup the PWM mode with Non-Inverting.
 *  Setup the prescaler with F_CPU/8.
 *  Setup the compare value based on the required input duty cycle
 *  Setup the direction for OC0 as output pin through the GPIO driver.
 *  The generated PWM signal frequency will be 500Hz to control the DC Motor speed.
 *  Inputs:
 *  duty_cycle: The required duty cycle percentage of the generated PWM signal. Its value should be from 0 â†’ 100
 *  Return: None
